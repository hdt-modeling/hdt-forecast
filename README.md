# Healthy Davis Together (HDT) Forecasting Efforts

## Usage

You will want to have a virtual environment (I placed this in my HDT root directory)
```
python -m venv env
```

Then activate with 
```
source env/bin/activate
```

Install the utilities package with 
```
pip install -e hdt_util
```

Run the tests for `hdt_util` with
```
cd hdt_util/tests
pytest
```
